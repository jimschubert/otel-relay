# TODO List

- Setup my common .github workflows (build, test, etc.)
- Create unit tests
- Expose metrics (e.g., via Prometheus)
- Implement configuration file support, with file-watch validation + reloading
- Add support for additional protocols (e.g. HTTP/JSON)
- Add support for additional socket output formats (e.g. JSON) rather than custom node formatting
- Maybe move formatting into inspector and dump raw signals as JSON to the socket?
- Add support to otel-inspector CLI for filtering signals based on attributes
